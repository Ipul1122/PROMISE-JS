The code above defines three asynchronous functions, each using Promise to simulate time-consuming operations. 
The functions walkCat, cleanRoom, and takeTrash each use setTimeout to wait for a few seconds before returning a result. 
These functions are then chained together using the then method of Promise to print the result of each operation sequentially. 
If any operation fails, an error message will be displayed using the catch method.
